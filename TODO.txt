- make list of steps of Gilian's method of privacy analysis, including how data is sampled and cleaned, etc.
- replicate this exact list for my method

- CART synthesis seems to be in a good place
- Need to run it for the small and full CRITEO data sets
- Test utility of the small and full CART CRITEO data sets
- Test privacy of new synthesis method
- Compute privacy of Ponte method on Criteo data
- Generate CART synthetic data sets for random forest as second use case (KL-divergence as optimization?)
- Further flesh out the use cases - make sure they make sense logically and are applicable
- Do some literature review and work on my TST presentation - how do we position this paper?

- Need to use Gilian's approach to computing epsilon values and recording undefined Epsilon values in my privacy risk analysis
