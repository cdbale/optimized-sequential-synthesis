- Need to go back and make sure multipliers used in privacy attack map to the correct epsilon values
- Add note to paper that we use the code of Ponte et al. as-is, but we note that the method for computing the theoretical
epsilon has since been updated to properly account for the sensitivity of microbatching, thus the true theoretical epsilon values
are likely higher than what is reported.

- Test utility of the full CART CRITEO data sets
- Compute privacy of Ponte method on Criteo data
- Generate CART synthetic data sets for random forest as second use case (KL-divergence as optimization?)
- Further flesh out the use cases - make sure they make sense logically and are applicable
- Do some literature review and work on my TST presentation - how do we position this paper?
