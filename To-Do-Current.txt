Outline for Paper with Harrison

- include analysis of utility of IPUMS data for a different data user model - if results are good, show that an advantage
of a general data synthesis approach is that the data is useful for multiple analyses without the need to manage a privacy
budget - but this comes at the cost of potentially reduced privacy for data subjects.

- run MOSTLY.AI data generation in python once a day - make a note in the paper about the relative advantages and
- disadvantages of each approach in terms of time

- replace the SK 0-4 MOSTLY.AI synthetic data sets

- check formatting and all references - delete extra bibtex entries
- check that all section, table, figure, and equation references in the text are correct

-cite IPUMS - condition for data usage
- include citation for my paper (if it gets published and includes the IPUMS data) in the IPUMS bibliography. See info using ipums_conditions() command in R.

- Introduction
- Literature Review
- Methods
- MOSTLY.AI Criteria (and Proof)
- Simulation Study
- Empirical Applications
	- South Korean COVID-19 Location Data
	- IPUMS data used in the other JASA paper
- Compare the generated data sets on the privacy (legal criteria and criteria often used in the literature, specifically, attribute disclosure risk and membership inference risk)
- Compare the generated data sets on the utility (use pMSE as a global measure and focus on the use case-specific measures, the one from the JASA paper is good)
- Conclusions

Look at new data for paper with Harrison.
* Need to do the synthesis using the MOSTLY.AI synthesizer as well.
* Need to turn off extreme value protection!

- run synthesis (M = 20) for both data sets with both metrics for optimization
	- use GMM on continuous variables with MNL for categorical variables*
	- use GMM on continuous variables with CART for categorical variables*
	- use Lasso regression for all variables
	- use CART for all variables
This means there will be 2x2x4 = 16 cases.

Privacy Measures
- MOSTLY.AI metrics
- Membership inference attack
- Attribute disclosure attacks (one continuous, one categorical?)

Utility Measures

2 Global measures
- pMSE score
- Hellinger distance

1 Analysis specific measure
- the location based measure Harrison discussed with me
- the regression from the JASA paper

- use appropriate combining rules for both and discuss results in depth
