To Do:

Include synthpop in IPUMS privacy and utility analyses.

When ready to do final run of the results section, re-train all of the MOSTLY.AI synthesizers on all data sets and re-generate synthetic data sets.
The python API is incredibly inconsistent, so we will generate the data sets manually (then they will also be saved online).

Do MOSTLY.AI synthesis on the non-normalized data. Let their method do its own process.

Do IPUMS synthesis on normalized data. Compute regression results on normalized, non-normalized, and non-normalized with log income and compare.

Note the inconsistencies with the pMSE ratio and the analysis-specific results. What are the implications of this?

- Sections to Edit:

1) Empirical Section

- cite IPUMS - condition for data usage
- include citation for my paper (if it gets published and includes the IPUMS data) in the IPUMS bibliography. See info using ipums_conditions() command in R.

- Privacy metrics (MOSTLY.AI measures, attribute disclosure)
- Utility measures
	- global (pMSE ratio)
	- analysis-specific
		- regression for state for SK data
		- regression for incwage for IPUMS data, specified as in JASA paper
		- include analysis of utility of IPUMS data for a different data user model - if results are good, show that an advantage
			of a general data synthesis approach is that the data is useful for multiple analyses without the need to manage a privacy
			budget - but this comes at the cost of potentially reduced privacy for data subjects.

- run MOSTLY.AI data generation in python once a day - make a note in the paper about the relative advantages and disadvantages of each approach in terms of time
