- define synthesis method
	GMM and MNL models (leaving CART out for now)
- conduct privacy analysis using defined synthesis method for multiple values of n, with two types of optimization (the pMSE
	based and the use case based, e.g., regression-based)
- move on and apply the defined synthesis method to the real Criteo data
- apply the differentially private method to the criteo data using a value of epsilon that corresponds to the maximum value from the privacy analysis
- compute utility loss using the same method as Ponte et al.
- Conduct a secondary synthesis analysis where the optimization is carried out based on the business use case
